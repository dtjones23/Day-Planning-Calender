# Day-Planning-Calender

# Description
The purpose of this project was to modify a jQuery-generated calendar that will allow a user to save events for a typical work day of 9am-5pm. Through the use of the day.js API, the user can view both the current date and time. Using day.js is what made it possible to for the user to be able to see the running time without having to refresh the page. The user will also notice that the background colors of the text area corresponds with the time of day aligned with past, present, and future. The objective of this project was to get the contents from a user to save and be readily accessible whenever they return to the page. Furthermore, this project was challenging but also helped with my ability to use jQuery and dayjs.

# Usage
- user type events into text area and save events by pressing save
